<h2>Two Undergrounds: The Case for Disobedience to Wicked Laws</h2>
<h3>By Carl Watner</h3>
</center>
In October 1850, several weeks after the date of the enactment
of the second Fugitive Slave Law, Charles Beecher, pastor of the
Free Presbyterian Church of Newark, New Jersey, preached a
sermon entitled "The Duty of Disobedience to Wicked Laws. " He
argued that the moral obligation to "feed the hungry and clothe
the naked" included the slave and the fugitive, and urged people
to break the Fugitive Slave Law:
<blockquote>
DISOBEY THIS LAW. ...I counsel no violence, I suggest no
warlike measures of resistance. I incite no man to deeds
of blood. ...As much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
men. To the fugitive, touching the question of self-defense,
I offer no advice, as none can be necessary. The right of
self-defense is unquestionable here, if ever. Of the
expediency of its exercise, each man must judge for
himself. I leave the question of self-defense undiscussed,
to the settlement of every man's own judgment, according
to circumstances.<br/>
But if a fugitive claims your help on his journey, break
the law and give it to him. The law is broken as thoroughly
by indirectly aiding his escape as directly, for both are
penal. Therefore break the law, and help him on his way,
directly if you can, indirectly if you must. Feed him, clothe
him, harbor him, by day and night, and conceal him from
his pursuers and from officers of the law. If you are
summoned to aid in his capture, refuse to obey. If you are
commanded by the officer to lay hands on the fugitive,
decline to comply;... .</blockquote>
During the years since 1850, there have been occasions in
American history when opponents of statist "law" either openly
disobeyed it or secretively went underground in order to evade
it. This includes the original Underground Railroad, conducted
by the Quakers and abolitionists, as well as the latter-day
underground railroad by which draft resisters were removed to
Canada during the Viet Nam War. Today another underground
railroad exists. Thousands of mothers (with their sexually abused
children in tow) are fleeing their abusive husbands and exhusbands
when the courts refuse to protect the children from
their fathers. Most often they are in violation of state custody
and visitation laws, and frequently there are outstanding
warrants for the mother's arrest. The mothers subject themselves
and their children to the arduous and sometimes frightening life
on the run in the hope that they can leave their past behind them,
and eventually settle into new lives, under assumed identities.
<br/><br/>
Sparked by a cover article they read in U.S. NEWS AND WORLD
REPORT (June 13, 1988, "Mothers on the Run"), Patricia and
Kevin Cullinane, operators of Freedom School, became part of
this modern-day underground network. The article spoke of the
unofficial head of the southeast underground, Faye Yager, who
had experienced first-hand the frequent injustices of the courts
in these matters, and decided to do something about it. The
Cullinanes contacted her, and offered to become a "safehouse. '
Much like the Underground Railroad of yesteryear, their
experiences have paralleled many of those who have resisted
State authority in the past. Besides presenting a brief overview
of voluntaryist resistance and disobedience, this article will
indicate the similarities between the Cullinanes' attempt to
protect one underground family and the attempts of the
abolitionists to shield fugitive slaves.
<br/><br/>
From September 22, 1988 until September 9, 1989, Freedom
Country, the home of Kevin and Patricia Cullinane, had been the
hiding place of Dona Washburn and her four children, ages 5 to
10.* Dona Washburn's life on the run began in May 1988, when
a ten-year old nephew reported that her husband, Derrell, had
sexually abused him. After talking with her children, Dona soon
came to believe that her husband had also been abusing their
children for a number of years. (It was only later that she learned
that several prominent members of the Macon, Georgia
community where she lived had been involved in perpetrating
this abuse as part of a large child pornography ring.) She
immediately began working with the Qeorgia Department of
Family and Child Services, but the resulting investigation was
inept and nearly non-existent. Medical evidence corroborating
the childrens' stories notwithstanding, Dona believed her
children were in imminent danger of being returned to the
custody of their father. She then requested assistance from Faye
Yager, who helped Dona and her children find a safe refuge.
<br/><br/>
After moving from house to house, around the country, Dona
and her children finally arrived at Freedom Country in
Campobello, South Carolina in September 1988. They moved into
the Cullinanes guest house, where they lived rent-free; the
Cullinanes provided all their food and necessities. Knowing that
a federal warrant for her arrest on charges of parental kidnapping
had been issued in June 1988, Dona did not work and homeschooled
her children. Their safe refuge came to an end on
September 9, 1989.
<br/><br/>
At about 7:40 a.m. that Saturday, the coercive apparatus of
the State converged upon the Cullinanes and Dona. A large
contingent of federal, state, and county authorities raided
Freedom Country. Led by at least one F.B.I, agent, approximately
40 Spartanburg County (S.C.) deputies and State Law
Enforcement Division personnel cut through a locked gate, and
sledge-hammered down the door of the house where Dona and
her children were living. A helicopter circled overhead, to prevent
escape on foot, and the five fugitives were quickly rounded up.
<br/><br/>
At the same time as the authorities were rounding up the
Washburns, Kevin Cullinane and his wife were awakened, with
guns trained on them, and were told that the F.B.I, was there.
Kevin rolled out of bed, grabbing and cocking his .45 pistol, and
demanded to see a search warrant. As soon as he ascertained
the warrant was legal, he put his gun down on the bed and
stepped away from it, never having pointed it at anyone. Shortly
thereafter, hearing the screams of Dona's children, knowing there
were other loaded guns in the house, and realizing his self-control
might slip, Cullinane requested that he be handcuffed in order
to restrain himself. The F.B.I, agent in charge of the raid complied
with his request, placing Kevin under arrest and taking him (with
Dona) to the nearest federal detention center. Kevin was not
arrested for threatening law enforcement officers with his gun,
but rather because he was handcuffed. According to judicial
guidelines a person is not to be handcuffed unless first placed
under arrest. Despite the fact that Dona and her children had
been seized before he was handcuffed, Kevin was charged with
violently interfering and impeding a federal officer who was
serving and executing a search warrant. Conviction on such
criminal charges carries a potential fine of $250,000 and up to
ten years in jail.
<br/><br/>
Although Dona was extradited to Georgia, and bailed out on
$15,000 bond, Kevin was detained in jail for 11 days before his
bail was set at $425,000. Using his real estate property as bond,
he was released, but not before discovering that the common
law rule of "innocent until proven guilty" had no application to
one accused of committing a serious federal crime. Kevin was
subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury, but a trial date
had not been set at the time of this writing. Meanwhile Dona is
fighting a legal battle for determining who will retain custody
of her children. For the time being, the state court in Macon has
ordered them into protective custody, meaning that the state
acts in loco parentis, until a final decision is reached.
<br/><br/>
Although Dona's case has not received much national
publicity, there is at least one "mother on the run" who has been
in the national spotlight. Elizabeth Morgan, a successful
Washington, D.C. plastic surgeon and author, was jailed in
August 1987, because she would not disclose the whereabouts
of her then five-year old daughter, Hilary. Citing medical and
psychological evidence, Dr. Morgan had accused her ex-husband,
Dr. Eric Foretich, a prosperous Virginia oral surgeon, of sexually
abusing their daughter since 1983. Citing his own expert
witnesses and evidence, Dr. Foretich denied the allegations of
abuse, and claims that Hilary was coached to lie about him. When
the D.C. courts continued to permit unsupervised visits by her
ex-husband, Dr. Morgan hid Hilary in 1987. For refusing to tell
the court where Hilary was hidden, Dr. Morgan had her home
seized, was fined $200,000, and was ordered to pay her
ex-husband's legal fees. She was also held in civil contempt of
court, and ordered imprisoned until she was ready to comply with
the court's order that she disclose Hilary's whereabouts. Refusing
to divulge the secret, she was held in jail over two years, until
Congress passed a special law in September 1989, designed to
release her. (The bill provided that no resident of Washington,
D.C. should be imprisoned for more than one year on contempt
of court in a child-custody case.) As it was, Dr. Morgan was held
in jail for civil contempt longer than anyone else in the judicial
history of the United States. Without the special legislation, she
could have remained in prison until her daughter was 18 years
old, and beyond the court's jurisdiction.
<br/><br/>
The use of civil contempt orders to enforce court decrees is
nothing new. Passmore Williamson, a Quaker lawyer in
Pennsylvania, became an abolitionist hero when he was held in
jail for three months during 1856, for participating in the rescue
of a female slave and her children, who had come to Philadelphia
with their master. After being accused in state court of forcible
abduction and assault, he was imprisoned for contempt of court,
when he said that he did not know where the slave mother was.
<br/><br/>
The pre-Civil War Underground Railroad began in the early
decades of the 19th Century, as Quakers and other sympathetic
northerners attempted to assist slaves making their way to
Canada and to freedom. Some conservative Quakers opposed
taking part in the Underground Railroad because it was illegal,
and some of the most zealous Quaker participants like Isaac
Hopper of New York—of whom it was said, "fugitive slaves know
him as well as they know the North Star"—were even disowned
by their own meetings. Another Quaker, Levi Coffin, was one of
the major figures of the Underground Railroad in the midwest.
Often referred to as the "President of the Underground,' Coffin
harbored more than one hundred fugitives a year in his house
in Newport, near Richmond, Indiana. Another Quaker member
of the Underground was Thomas Qarrett, a shoe merchant in
Wilmington, Delaware. A big confident man, he gathered around
him a group of people, black and white, violent and nonviolent,
who rendered assistance to fugitive slaves. One such person was
Harriet Tubman, the Negro conductress who made a score of trips
into the South to lead slaves to freedom. Qarrett himself lost all
his worldly possessions in 1848, at sixty years of age, when he
was prosecuted by a Maryland slave owner and had a judgment
levied and executed against him for having helped the man's
slaves escape.
<br/><br/>
It is estimated that the Underground Railroad helped between
40,000 and 100,000 slaves, but not all escapes were successful.
Henry "Box" Brown was one of the lucky fugitives. In 1849, he
originated the idea of being shipped north in a wooden box.
Samuel Smith, a Richmond shoe dealer who made the box for
Brown, helped two other slaves by making them boxes and
shipping them off. However rumors about Smith's boxes had
spread and the boxes were intercepted. The slaves were forced
back into slavery, and Smith went to prison for seven years for
violating state and federal fugitive slave laws. These statutes
were passed by the southern states, as well as by the federal
government, in order to enforce the provision of the U.S.
Constitution which required that a "person held to service or
labor in one State, ...escaping into another shall, " not "be
discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered
upon claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be
due." (Article IV, Sec. 2, sub 3.)
<br/><br/>
The first federal statute of 1793, provided that any federal
district or circuit judge or any authorized state magistrate could
decide (without a jury trial) the status of an alleged fugitive. This
measure met with resistance in the northern states, resulting
in the passage of state Personal Liberty Laws (Indiana, 1824;
Connecticut, 1828; New York and Vermont, 1840; Massachusetts,
1843; Pennsylvania, 1847; Rhode Island, 1848) under which state
officials were prohibited from enforcing the law or permitting
the use of state jails to hold fugitives captured by the federal
authorities. Some state laws extended the right of jury trial to
those fugitives who appealed the original judicial decision
ordering them to be returned to the south.
<br/><br/>
The second Fugitive Slave Law (which was passed as part of
the Compromise of 1850, and which was not repealed until 1864)
made life more difficult for the escaped slave, as well as for those
assisting him. First, federal judges were no longer to decide the
fate of the slave; rather special commissioners were to make
decisions in a summary hearing. Second, the fugitive slave could
no longer testify in his own behalf, and he was still not entitled
to a jury trial. Third, penalties were imposed upon marshalls who
refused to enforce the law or from whom fugitives escaped; those
convicted of assisting the fugitive could be fined $1000 and jailed
for six months. Emphasis was placed on convictions, since the
special commissioners were paid a fee of $10 when their
decisions favored the claimant, and only $5 when they favored
the fugitive. As a result of the new federal law, resistance in the
northern states increased and a new spate of Personal Liberty
Laws was passed. These laws forbade state officials from
assisting in the recapture of slaves, extended the right of habeas
corpus and trial by jury to the fugitive, and punished false
testimony severely. At least one confederate state referred to
these laws as a justification for secession at the outbreak of the
Civil War.
<br/><br/>
The new federal law strengthened the will of those opposed
to slavery. It resulted in heightened activity on the Underground
Railroad and prompted anti-slavery men to rescue slaves who
were being held in the north, pending their return to slavery. The
first attempt after the passage of the act to return an escaped
fugitive from Boston met with failure in early 1851. Federal
officers arrested Shadrach, a waiter in a Boston coffeehouse, on
the claim that he was an escaped Virginia slave. He was taken
to the courthouse, but a large mob of free Negroes entered the
courtroom. Moving about in a hubbub of laughter and jostling,
the mob leaders hid Shadrach from the view of the officers long
enough to rush him out of the room and start him on his way
to Canada. Secretary of State Daniel Webster, called the rescue
treason, and it induced Senator Henry Clay to call for
strengthening the provisions of the new law. When Thomas Sims,
another Negro, was apprehended later the same year in Boston,
the federal authorities viewed his rendition as a test of their
strength. The courthouse was ringed with chains and troops.
William Lloyd Garrison's LIBERATOR proclaimed, 'Justice in
Chains. " A vigilance committee plotted another rescue, but the
attempt was unsuccessful.
<br/><br/>
By 1854, some fifty or sixty slaves had actually been forced
to return south under the Fugitive Slave Law. In that year,
Anthony Burns, a young Negro tailor and ministerial student in
Boston, was claimed by a Virginia slave owner. Abolitionists in
Boston became determined to resist his removal. Officials held
Burns in a courthouse. A small group of men, led by a local
antislavery pastor, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, battered the
courthouse door down with a wooden beam. In the process a
guard was killed and the mob retreated, deciding that its
numbers were insufficient to effect Burns' rescue. State and
federal troops poured into Boston to prevent another rescue
attempt, and large crowds milled about the courthouse. Public
sentiment was clearly against any attempt to take Burns south:
William Lloyd Garrison and three hundred friends of liberty
marched about the courthouse square carrying freedom
placards; protesting citizens draped their stores and offices in
black or hung American flags upside down; all day and night
Negroes stood on the sidewalk outside the hotel where Burns'
master was staying, in a nonviolent protest vigil. Officials
gathered the largest military force in Boston since the time of
the American Revolution to prevent citizen interference when
Burns was taken from the courthouse to a waiting government
cutter in the Boston harbor. Although Burns was returned to
Virginia, further protest meetings were held in Massachusetts.
At one in Framingham, William Lloyd Garrison held up a copy
of the Fugitive Slave law and burned it. Then he held up a copy
of the United States Constitution under which Burns had been
returned to slavery, and he denounced it as "a covenant with
death, and an agreement with hell. " Thereupon he burned it,
saying, "So perish all compromises with tyranny! "
<br/><br/>
The question of obeying or disobeying the law is an age old
question in Western political philosophy. So long as there have
been organized political States, men have been faced with the
problem of what to do when the dictates of their reason and
conscience tell them to do otherwise than what the State commands
them to do. Though the consequences may not be simple
or palatable, the voluntaryist answer is relatively straight
forward—obey no law which violates one's conscience (especially
those which require the doing of physical harm or injury to
another person). Law in the voluntaryist sense of the word is
something existing in the nature of the real world, such as
physical laws (i.e., the law of gravity), or something required by
the nature of man, such as the recognition that man must
produce in order to survive. Political statutes, political
regulations, and statist restrictions upon man's activities are not
laws. They are nothing else other then commands sanctioned
by the legitimacy of those issuing the orders, and backed up by
violent force. Hence, in disobeying political statutes one is not
disobeying true law.
<br/><br/>
In one sense every political "law" is wicked; that is, all
legislation is an absurdity, usurpation, and a crime. " It is absurd
to think that political rulers can promulgate "laws" of their own.
Nothing could be right by political enactment, if it was not first
right by nature. If the government directs something to be done
that is contrary to reason, then it is reasonable to defy the
government. If the government decrees something to be done,
which reason indicates should be done anyway, then statist
legislation is superfluous.
<br/><br/>
It is in this light that we can distinguish between just and
unjust political "laws." The Roman natural law theorists, who
coined the expression Lex Injusta non est Lex (an unjust law is
no law at all), assumed that truth and right are objective, and
can be ascertained by man's ability to reason. Since an unjust
or wicked political "law" is no law at all, it may be or even must
be disobeyed—for if it is not "law" then there is no natural
penalty attached to its violation. The person who believes a
political "law" is unjust might on the same grounds, refuse to
pay the statist penalty for its violation. The punishment is
actually a further aspect of the very political "law" that has been
disobeyed. So while there is nothing inherently wrong in
disobeying a "political" law or in refusing to accept the penalty,
there may be no easy or practical way of avoiding the
consequences of disobeying statist "law" and the punishment
it exacts.
<br/><br/>
The existence of an underground railway, whether it be the
19th Century version, or a 20th Century one, shows dramatically
how important public opinion and public sentiment are to the
legitimacy of the State. If there is too broad a chasm between
the dictates of political "law" and people's consciences, then the
State begins to lose legitimacy. People are forced to decide
between doing what they think is right or doing what their
statesmen direct under threat of force. Abraham Lincoln, at the
time of the Civil War, recognized that public support was all
important to the enforcement of political "laws" and the success
of the State:
<blockquote>
Public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment,
nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed.
Consequently he who moulds public sentiment goes deeper
than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions. He
makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be
executed.
</blockquote>
Those abolitionists who refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave
Law, and their modern day counterparts who harbor fugitive
mothers on the run, have clearly decided that the best way to
nullify bad laws is to disobey or ignore them. Their claim to
violate "laws" of their own choosing is not a claim to violate all
laws, but rather only the unjust or wicked ones. They recognize
the need for societal-wide rules based on reason, but they do not
accede to political "laws" which require that they ignore those
in need or that they do injury or harm to others. Their behavior
parallels Henry David Thoreau's dictum that,"It is not desirable
to cultivate a respect for the [political] law so much as for the
right."<br/><br/>

<center><strong>Addendum</strong></center><br/>
On October 21, 1989, Superior Court Judge John Lee Parrott
ordered Dona Washburn's four children removed from protective
custody and turned over to their father, permanently. This was
done in spite of expert medical testimony which confirmed sexual
abuse of the children, in spite of the fact that the attorney for
the Georgia Department of Family and Child Services recommended
the children be returned to protective custody, and that
the children continued to accuse the father of having molested
them. Judge Parrott further ordered that Dona Washburn
undergo psychiatric treatment, before he would allow her to visit
her children. Dona has retained a new attorney, and is continuing
her legal fight for the children.
<br/><br/>
Kevin Cullinane was acquitted of all charges by a federal jury
in Greenville, S.C. on December 11. The jury determined that he
neither "knowingly and willfully" assaulted a federal officer with
a deadly weapon, nor "knowingly and willfully" impeded the
execution of a federal search warrant.
<br/><br/>
As a result of the newspaper publicity surrounding Cullinanes
indictment, a local I.R.S. agent "decided" to check his tax
records, and found that Cullinane had not filed personal tax
returns since 1981. As the agent put it, "If a person is willing
to break one law, he's often willing to break a second law." As
a result of this investigation, Cullinane is now faced with a tax
bill from the Internal Revenue Service for more than $477,000.
The I.R.S. action took place less than two weeks before
Cullinane's trial and was clearly politically instigated. The only
way the I.R.S. could have had access to some of the "alleged"
information was by way of the F.B.I. A Notice of Jeopardy
Assessment and Tax Lien were filed (without prior notice) against
Cullinane because the I.R.S. thought he appeared to be
"designing to quickly depart from the United States or to
conceal" himself, and "place (his) assets beyond the reach of the
Government... . " (Neither allegation was true.)
<br/><br/>
In deciding upon their action, the I.R.S. asserted that
1) Cullinane was a member of an underground network
concealing fugitive women and children from federal and state
authorities; 2) foreign currency was found in his home by federal
agents executing a search warrant; 3) he had not filed income
tax returns for a number of years; 4) his real property was for
sale (it has been since October 1988); and 5) he used an alias
to conceal payments he received and assets he owned. There was
just enough substance to these spurious claims to make them
look as if they may have been true. Although the local I.R.S.
people were unaware of it, Cullinane had recently filed some of
his back returns, and according to his accountant the amount
owed (even after computing penalties and interest) was far less
than the amount claimed by the I.R.S. It is clear that federal
agents must have had a "cover" on Cullinane's mail because they
were apparently confused by the many different people at his
home receiving mail (Cullinane does not use an alias). Other than
one piece of currency brought to Freedom Country by his
Argentine son-in-law, there was no foreign currency on the
premises; nor was there any underground network of which he
could be a member.
<br/><br/>
The Cullinane affair is a perfect illustration of the "bag of
tricks" and "double standard" by which the State works. Most
of the I.R.S. charges were pure fabrications and required no proof
on their part. Any of us could be accused of the same "crimes."
If he had been convicted of violently interfering with the execution
of a search warrant, Cullinane could have been jailed for
10 years, and fined $250,000, a sentence far in excess of that
given to people convicted of manslaughter. Why is it worse to
assault a federal agent than to kill your neighbor? It wouldn't
be because the State wants to strike fear into the hearts and souls
of its citizens, and have them remain compliant and docile in
the face of its coercive apparatus? Even though Cullinane was
acquitted, he is faced with large legal bills, for which he is
personally responsible. The entire federal law enforcement
system which charged him and then tried his case is paid for by
the hapless taxpayers. The federal tax lien against him makes
it impossible to sell his property without obtaining permission
from the I.R.S., and if he cannot reach an amicable agreement
with them over the amount due, the I.R.S. clearly has the last
say, as his property may be seized and auctioned off.
<br/><br/>
Legal defense funds have been established for both Kevin
Cullinane, and Dona Washburn and her children: The Kevin
Cullinane Legal Defense Fund, c/o Anthony L. Hargis of Co., 1515
W. MacArthur Boulevard, #19, Costa Mesa, California 92626; and
