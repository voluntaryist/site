<h3>The Right to Ignore the State</h3>
<h4>by Herbert Spencer</h4>
<br>
This essay was taken from Chapter XIX of the 1851 edition of <i>Social Statics</i>.<br />

<hr><p>
<b>1.</b> As a corollary to the proposition that all institutions must
be subordinated to the law of equal freedom, we cannot choose but admit
the right of the citizen to adopt a condition of voluntary outlawry. If
every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes
not the equal freedom of any other man, then he is free to drop
connection with the state - to relinquish its protection and to refuse
paying toward its support. It is self-evident that in so behaving he in
no way trenches upon the liberty of others, for his position is a
passive one, and while passive he cannot become an aggressor. It is
equally self-evident that he cannot be compelled to continue one of a
political corporation without a breach of the moral law, seeing that
citizenship involves payment of taxes; and the taking away of a man's
property against his will is an infringement of his rights. Government
being simply an agent employed in common by a number of individuals to
secure to them certain advantages, the very nature of the connection
implies that it is for each to say whether he will employ such an agent
or not. If anyone of them determines to ignore this mutual-safety
confederation, nothing can be said except that he loses all claim to
its good offices and exposes himself to the danger of maltreatment - a
thing he is quite at liberty to do if he likes. He cannot be coerced
into political combination without a breach of the law of equal
freedom; he can withdraw from it without committing any such breach,
and he has therefore a right so to withdraw.
</p><p><br>
<b>2.</b> "No human laws are of any validity if contrary to the law of
nature; and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all
their authority mediately or immediately from this original." Thus
writes Blackstone, to whom let all honor be given for having so far
outseen the ideas of his time and, indeed, we may say of our time. A
good antidote, this, for those political superstitions which so widely
prevail. A good check upon that sentiment of power worship which still
misleads us by magnifying the prerogatives of constitutional
governments as it once did those of monarchs. Let men learn that a
legislature is <i>not</i> "our God upon earth," though, by the
authority they ascribe to it and the things they expect from it, they
would seem to think it is. Let them learn rather that it is an
institution serving a purely temporary purpose, whose power, when not
stolen, is at best borrowed.
</p><p>Nay, indeed, have we not seen that government is essentially
immoral? Is it not the offspring of evil, bearing about it all the
marks of its parentage? Does it not exist because crime exists? Is it
not strong - or, as we say, despotic - when crime is great? Is there
not more liberty - that is, less government - when crime diminishes?
And must not government cease when crime ceases, for very lack of
objects on which to perform its function? Not only does magisterial
power exist <i>because</i> of evil, but it exists <i>by</i>

evil. Violence is employed to maintain it, and all violence involves
criminality. Soldiers, policemen, and jailers; swords, batons, and
fetters are instruments for inflicting pain; and all inflection of pain
is in the abstract wrong. The state employs evil weapons to subjugate
evil and is alike contaminated by the objects with which it deals and
the means by which it works. Morality cannot recognize it, for
morality, being simply a statement of the perfect law, can give no
countenance to anything growing out of, and living by, breaches of that
law. Wherefore, legislative authority can never be ethical - must
always be conventional merely.
</p><p>Hence, there is a certain inconsistency in the attempt to
determine the right position, structure, and conduct of a government by
appeal to the first principles of rectitude. For as just pointed out,
the acts of an institution which is in both nature and origin imperfect
cannot be made to square with the perfect law. All that we can do is to
ascertain, firstly, in what attitude a legislature must stand to the
community to avoid being by its mere existence an embodied wrong;
secondly, in what manner it must be constituted so as to exhibit the
least incongruity with the moral law; and thirdly, to what sphere its
actions must be limited to prevent it from multiplying those breaches
of equity it is set up to prevent.
</p><p>The first condition to be conformed to before a legislature can
be established without violating the law of equal freedom is the
acknowledgment of the right now under discussion - the right to ignore
the state.
</p><p><br>
<b>3.</b> Upholders of pure despotism may fitly believe state control
to be unlimited and unconditional. They who assert that men are made
for governments and not governments for men may consistently hold that
no one can remove himself beyond the pale of political organization.
But they who maintain that the people are the only legitimate source of
power - that legislative authority is not original, but deputed -
cannot deny the right to ignore the state without entangling themselves
in an absurdity.
</p><p>For, if legislative authority is deputed, it follows that those
from whom it proceeds are the masters of those on whom it is conferred;
it follows further that as masters they confer the said authority
voluntarily; and this implies that they may give or withhold it as they
please. To call that deputed which is wrenched from men, whether they
will or not, is nonsense. But what is here true of all collectively is
equally true of each separately. As a government can rightly act for
the people only when empowered by them, so also can it rightly act for
the individual only when empowered by him. If A, B, and C debate
whether they shall employ an agent to perform for them a certain
service, and if while A and B agree to do so C dissents, C cannot
equitably be made a party to the agreement in spite of himself. And
this must be equally true of thirty as of three; and if of thirty, why
not of three hundred, or three thousand, or three million?
</p><p><br>
<b>4.</b> Of the political superstitions lately alluded to, none is so
universally diffused as the notion that majorities are omnipotent.
Under the impression that the preservation of order will ever require
power to be wielded by some party, the moral sense of our time feels
that such power cannot rightly be conferred on any but the largest
moiety of society. It interprets literally the saying that "the voice
of the people is the voice of God," and, transferring to the one the
sacredness attached to the other, it concludes that from the will of
the people - that is, of the majority - there can be no appeal. Yet is
this belief entirely erroneous.
</p><p>Suppose, for the sake of argument, that, struck by some
Malthusian panic, a legislature duly representing public opinion were
to enact that all children born during the next ten years should be
drowned. Does anyone think such an enactment would be warrantable? If
not, there is evidently a limit to the power of a majority. Suppose,
again, that of two races living together - Celts and Saxons, for
example - the most numerous determined to make the others their slaves.
Would the authority of the greatest number be in such case valid? If
not, there is something to which its authority must be subordinate.
Suppose, once more, that all men having incomes under £ 50 a year were
to resolve upon reducing every income above that amount to their own
standard, and appropriating the excess for public purposes. Could their
resolution be justified? If not, it must be a third time confessed that
there is a law to which the popular voice must defer. What, then, is
that law, if not the law of pure equity - the law of equal freedom?
These restraints, which all would put to the will of the majority, are
exactly the restraints set up by that law. We deny the right of a
majority to murder, to enslave, or to rob, simply because murder,
enslaving, and robbery are violations of that law - violations too
gross to be overlooked. But if great violations of it are wrong, so
also are smaller ones. If the will of the many cannot supersede the
first principle of morality in these cases, neither can it in any. So
that, however insignificant the minority, and however trifling the
proposed trespass against their rights, no such trespass is
permissible.
</p><p>When we have made our constitution purely democratic, thinks to
himself the earnest reformer, we shall have brought government into
harmony with absolute justice. Such a faith, though perhaps needful for
the age, is a very erroneous one. By no process can coercion be made
equitable. The freest form of government is only the least
objectionable form. The rule of the many by the few we call tyranny;
the rule of the few by the many is tyranny also, only of a less intense
kind. "You shall do as we will, and not as you will," is in either case
the declaration; and if the hundred make it to the ninety-nine, instead
of the ninety-nine to the hundred, it is only a fraction less immoral.
Of two such parties, whichever fulfills this declaration necessarily
breaks the law of equal freedom: the only difference being that by the
one it is broken in the persons of ninety-nine, while by the other it
is broken in the persons of a hundred. And the merit of the democratic
form of government consists solely in this, that it trespasses against
the smallest number.
</p><p>The very existence of majorities and minorities is indicative
of an immoral state. The man whose character harmonizes with the moral
law, we found to be one who can obtain complete happiness without
diminishing the happiness of his fellows. But the enactment of public
arrangements by vote implies a society consisting of men otherwise
constituted - implies that the desires of some cannot be satisfied
without sacrificing the desires of others - implies in the pursuit of
their happiness the majority inflict a certain amount of unhappiness on
the minority - implies, therefore, organic immorality. Thus, from
another point of view, we again perceive that even in its most
equitable form it is impossible for government to dissociate itself
from evil; and further, that unless the right to ignore the state is
recognized, its acts must be essentially criminal.
</p><p><br>
<b>5.</b> That a man is free to abandon the benefits and throw off the
burdens of citizenship may indeed be inferred from the admissions of
existing authorities and of current opinion. Unprepared as they
probably are for so extreme a doctrine as the one here maintained, the
radicals of our day yet unwittingly profess their belief in a maxim
which obviously embodies this doctrine. Do we not continually hear them
quote Blackstone's assertion that "no subject of England can be
constrained to pay any aids or taxes even for the defence of the realm
or the support of government, but such as are imposed by his own
consent, or that of his representative in parliament?" And what does
this mean? It means, say they, that every man should have a vote. True,
but it means much more. If there is any sense in words it is a distinct
enunciation of the right now contended for. In affirming that a man may
not be taxed unless he has directly or indirectly given his consent, it
affirms that he may refuse to be so taxed; and to refuse to be taxed is
to cut all connection with the state. Perhaps it will be said that this
consent is not a specific, but a general one, and that the citizen is
understood to have assented to everything his representative may do
when he voted for him. But suppose he did not vote for him, and on the
contrary did all in his power to get elected someone holding opposite
views - what then? The reply will probably be that, by taking part in
such an election, he tacitly agreed to abide by the decision of the
majority. And how if he did not vote at all? Why, then he cannot justly
complain of any tax, seeing that he made no protest against its
imposition. So, curiously enough, it seems that he gave his consent in
whatever way he acted - whether he said yes, whether he said no, or
whether he remained neuter! A rather awkward doctrine, this. Here
stands an unfortunate citizen who is asked if he will pay money for a
certain proffered advantage; and whether he employs the only means of
expressing his refusal or does not employ it, we are told that he
practically agrees, if only the number of others who agree is greater
than the number of those who dissent. And thus we are introduced to the
novel principle that A's consent to a thing is not determined by what A
says, but by what B may happen to say!

</p><p>It is for those who quote Blackstone to choose between this
absurdity and the doctrine above set forth. Either his maxim implies
the right to ignore the state, or it is sheer nonsense.
</p><p><br>
<b>6.</b> There is a strange heterogeneity in our political faiths.
Systems that have had their day and are beginning here and there to let
the daylight through are patched with modern notions utterly unlike in
quality and color; and men gravely display these systems, wear them,
and walk about in them, quite unconscious of their grotesqueness. This
transition state of ours, partaking as it does equally of the past and
the future, breeds hybrid theories exhibiting the oddest union of
bygone despotism and coming freedom. Here are types of the old
organization curiously disguised by germs of the new, peculiarities
showing adaptation to a preceding state modified by rudiments that
prophesy of something to come, making altogether so chaotic a mixture
of relationships that there is no saying to what class these births of
the age should be referred.
</p><p>As ideas must of necessity bear the stamp of the time, it is
useless to lament the contentment with which these incongruous beliefs
are held. Otherwise it would seem unfortunate that men do not pursue to
the end the trains of reasoning which have led to these partial
modifications. In the present case for example, consistency would force
them to admit that, on other points besides the one just noticed, they
hold opinions and use arguments in which the right to ignore the state
is involved.
</p><p>For what is the meaning of Dissent? The time was when a man's
faith and his mode of worship were as much determinable by law as his
secular acts; and, according to provisions extant in our statute book,
are so still. Thanks to the growth of a Protestant spirit, however, we
have ignored the state in this matter - wholly in theory, and partly in
practice. But how have we done so? By assuming an attitude which, if
consistently maintained, implies a right to ignore the state entirely.
Observe the positions of the two parties. "This is your creed," says
the legislator; "you must believe and openly profess what is here set
down for you." "I shall not do anything of the kind," answers the
nonconformist; "I will go to prison rather." "Your religious
ordinances," pursues the legislator, "shall be such as we have
prescribed. You shall attend the churches we have endowed and adopt the
ceremonies used in them." "Nothing shall induce me to do so," is the
reply; "I altogether deny your power to dictate to me in such matters,
and mean to resist to the uttermost." "Lastly," adds the legislator,
"we shall require you to pay such sums of money toward the support of
these religious institutions as we may see fit to ask." "Not a farthing
will you have from me," exclaims our sturdy Independent; "even did I
believe in the doctrines of your church (which I do not), I should
still rebel against your interference; and if you take my property, it
shall be by force and under protest."
</p><p>What now does this proceeding amount to when regarded in the
abstract? It amounts to an assertion by the individual of the right to
exercise on of his faculties - the religious sentiment - without let or
hinderance, and with no limit save that set up by the equal claims of
others. And what is meant by ignoring the state? Simply an assertion of
the right similarly to exercise <i> all</i>
the faculties. The one is just an expansion of the other - rests on the
same footing with the other - must stand or fall with the other. Men do
indeed speak of civil and religious liberty as different things: but
the distinction is quite arbitrary. They are parts of the same whole
and cannot philosophically be separated.
</p><p>"Yes they can," interposes the objector; "assertion of the one
is imperative as being a religious duty. The liberty to worship God in
the way that seems to him right is a liberty without which a man cannot
fulfill what he believes to be Divine commands, and therefore
conscience requires him to maintain it." True enough; but how if the
same can be asserted of all other liberty? How if maintenance of this
also turns out to be a matter of conscience? Have we not seen that
human happiness is the Divine will - that only by exercising our
faculties is this happiness obtainable - and that it is impossible to
exercise them without freedom? And if this freedom for the exercise of
faculties is a condition without which the Divine will cannot be
fulfilled, the preservation of it is, by our objector's own showing, a
duty. Or, in other words, it appears not only that the maintenance of
liberty of action <i>may</i> be a point of conscience, but that it <i>ought</i>

to be one. And thus we are clearly shown that the claims to ignore the
state in religious and in secular matters are in essence identical.
</p><p>The other reason commonly assigned for nonconformity admits of
similar treatment. Besides resisting state dictation in the abstract,
the dissenter resists it from disapprobation of the doctrines taught.
No legislative injunction will make him adopt what he considers an
erroneous belief; and, bearing in mind his duty toward his fellow men,
he refuses to help through the medium of his purse in disseminating
this erroneous belief. The position is perfectly intelligible. But it
is one which either commits its adherents to civil nonconformity also,
or leaves them in a dilemma. For why do they refuse to be instrumental
in spreading error? Because error is adverse to human happiness. And on
what ground is any piece of secular legislation disapproved? For the
same reason - because thought adverse to human happiness. How, then,
can it be shown that the state ought to be resisted in the one case and
not in the other? Will anyone deliberately assert that if a government
demands money from us to aid in <i>teaching</i> what we think will produce evil we ought to refuse it, but that if the money is for the purpose of <i>doing</i>
what we think will produce evil we ought not to refuse it? Yet such is
the hopeful proposition which those have to maintain who recognize the
right to ignore the state in religious matters but deny it in civil
matters.
</p><p><br>
<b>7.</b> The substance of this chapter once more reminds us of the
incongruity between a perfect law and an imperfect state. The
impracticability of the principle here laid down varies directly as
social morality. In a thoroughly vicious community its admission would
be productive of anarchy. In a completely virtuous one its admission
will be both innocuous and inevitable. Progress toward a condition of
social health - a condition, that is, in which the remedial measures of
legislation will no longer be needed - is progress toward a condition
in which those remedial measures will be cast aside and the authority
prescribing them disregarded. The two changes are of necessity
co-ordinate. That moral sense whose supremacy will make society
harmonious and government unnecessary is the same moral sense which
will then make each man assert his freedom even to the extent of
ignoring the state - is the same moral sense which, by deterring the
majority from coercing the minority, will eventually render government
impossible. And as what are merely different manifestations of the same
sentiment must bear a constant ratio to each other, the tendency to
repudiate governments will increase only at the same rate that
governments become needless.
</p><p>Let not any be alarmed, therefore, at the promulgation of the
foregoing doctrine. There are many changes yet to be passed through
before it can begin to exercise much influence. Probably a long time
will elapse before the right to ignore the state will be generally
admitted, even in theory. It will be still longer before it receives
legislative recognition. And even then there will be plenty of checks
upon the premature exercise of it. A sharp experience will sufficiently
instruct those who may too soon abandon legal protection. While, in the
majority of men, there is such a love of tried arrangements and so
great a dread of experiments that they will probably not act upon this
right until long after it is safe to do so.</p>
