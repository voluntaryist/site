            <sup>2</sup>This comparison only includes counterfeit paper notes, not attempted fakes of metallic coins. During the heyday of real money, numerous devices, described as counterfeit or fake money detectors, existed. In the United States the “Gold Prohibition Act of 1934 calling for the confiscation of all gold coins, except those considered ‘rare,’ marked the disappearance of the fake coin detector.” Their modern counterpart is available through Fisch Instruments.
